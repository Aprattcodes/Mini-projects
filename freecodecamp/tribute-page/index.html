                    <p><b>(November 30, 1904 – June 23, 1980) </b>was an American painter, and one of the leading figures in the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, 
                    who developed a new, powerful approach to painting in the years immediately following World War II. 
                    Still has been credited with laying the groundwork for the movement, as his shift from representational 
                    to abstract painting occurred between 1938 and 1942, earlier than his colleagues like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, 
                    who continued to paint in figurative-surrealist styles well into the 1940s.</p>

                    <p><b>(1904)</b> Still was born in Grandin, North Dakota and spent his childhood in Spokane, Washington and Bow Island in southern Alberta, Canada. In 1925 he visited New York, briefly studying at the Art Students League. He attended Spokane University from 1926 to 1927 and returned in 1931 with a fellowship, graduating in 1933. That fall, 
                        he became a teaching fellow, then faculty member at Washington State 
                        College (now Washington State University), where he obtained his Master 
                        of Fine Arts degree in 1935 and taught until 1941. 
                        He spent the summers of 1934 and 1935 at the Trask Foundation 
                        (now Yaddo) in Saratoga Springs, New York.</p>

                <li class="line">
                    <p><b>(1941)</b> Still relocated to the San Francisco Bay area where he worked in various war 
                        industries while pursuing painting. He had his first solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) in 1943. 
                        He taught at the Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), now Virginia 
                        Commonwealth University, from 1943 to 1945, then went to New York City.</p>

                    <p><b>Clifford Still</b> is considered one of the foremost Color Field painters – 
                        his non-figurative paintings are non-objective, and largely concerned 
                        with juxtaposing different colors and surfaces in a variety of formations. 
                        Unlike Mark Rothko or Barnett Newman, who organized their colors in a relatively simple way (Rothko in the form of nebulous rectangles, 
                        Newman in thin lines on vast fields of color), Still's arrangements are less regular. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been 
                        "torn" off the painting, revealing the colors underneath. </p>
